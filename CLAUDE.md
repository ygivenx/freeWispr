# FreeWispr — Architecture Guide

## Overview

FreeWispr is a privacy-first, local dictation app for macOS. It runs as a menu bar utility using push-to-talk: hold a hotkey to record, release to transcribe, text appears wherever your cursor is. All processing happens on-device via whisper.cpp with Core ML acceleration.

## Data Flow

```
User holds hotkey (Ctrl+Option or Globe)
        ↓
HotkeyManager detects key via CGEvent tap
        ↓
AppState.startRecording() → captures frontmost app, shows recording indicator
        ↓
AudioRecorder captures mic → converts to 16kHz PCM float32
        ↓
User releases hotkey
        ↓
AudioRecorder.stopRecording() → emits [Float] samples
        ↓
Audio validation: reject < 0.3s or silence, normalize peak to 0.7
        ↓
WhisperTranscriber.transcribe(samples) → whisper.cpp inference (30s timeout)
        ↓
TextCorrector.correct(text) → on-device LLM fix (5s timeout, macOS 26+)
        ↓
TextInjector.injectText(text) → clipboard + Cmd+V paste
        ↓
Previous clipboard restored after 0.5s
```

## Core Components

### AppState.swift — Orchestrator
Central `@MainActor` state machine. Owns all managers, coordinates the full lifecycle:
- `setup()` — check permissions, download model, load model, start hotkey
- `startRecording()` — captures frontmost app context, starts mic, shows recording indicator
- `stopAndTranscribe()` — stops mic, validates audio (min duration, silence), normalizes peak, transcribes, optionally corrects via LLM
- `switchModel(to:)` — downloads new model first (keeping previous functional), then unloads and reloads

### HotkeyManager.swift — Global Hotkey
Uses `CGEvent.tapCreate()` to listen for modifier key changes system-wide. Detects Globe key (`maskSecondaryFn`) or Ctrl+Option combo. Requires Accessibility permission. Fires `onHotkeyDown` / `onHotkeyUp` callbacks.

### AudioRecorder.swift — Audio Capture
A main-actor recorder opens a fresh default-microphone engine for every recording via the native `MicrophoneCapture` target. It rejects a busy microphone, validates the live format, installs a tap without forcing a cached format, and retries startup once. Native engine operations catch Objective-C exceptions and release taps/observers on teardown. Configuration changes arrive on the main queue, are matched to the current session, and discard interrupted audio while resetting the UI. `AudioCaptureBuffer` owns each attempt's samples/converter and serializes conversion/finalization on a dedicated queue; it supplies each input buffer only once and converts delivered formats to 16kHz mono float32. Tests inject engines and a native exception fixture without opening the microphone.

### WhisperTranscriber.swift — Inference
Main-actor wrapper around SwiftWhisper with a guard against overlapping inference. Loads GGML model with greedy decoding, English language preset, single-segment mode for speed. Transcription is async — returns joined segment text. 30-second timeout cancels inference via whisper.cpp abort callback. Periodically reloads model (every 50 transcriptions) to reclaim whisper.cpp KV cache memory.

### ModelManager.swift — Model Lifecycle
Downloads GGML weights + Core ML encoder from Hugging Face. Stores in `~/Library/Application Support/FreeWispr/models/`. Tracks download progress (70% GGML, 30% Core ML). Core ML encoder is downloaded as `.zip` and extracted via `/usr/bin/unzip`. Validates GGML files after download (magic byte check) and auto-deletes corrupt files.

Model sizes: tiny (~75MB), base (~142MB, default), small (~466MB), medium (~1.5GB).

### TextCorrector.swift — LLM Correction (macOS 26+)
On-device text correction via Apple Intelligence FoundationModels framework. Fixes punctuation, capitalization, and homophones in Whisper output. 5-second timeout races LLM against raw transcription. App-aware context adjusts instructions for code editors (preserve camelCase/snake_case), browsers, and messaging apps. Includes refusal detection to fall back gracefully.

### RecordingIndicator.swift — Visual Feedback
Floating 12px red dot at top-center of screen using `NSPanel` at status-window level. Pulse animation respects `accessibilityDisplayShouldReduceMotion`. Visible on all Spaces, ignores mouse events. Screen-change notifications reposition the panel after external-monitor changes; observers and panels are cleaned up on teardown.

### UpdateChecker.swift — Auto-Update
Checks GitHub Releases API for newer versions. Verifies DMG code signature via `SecStaticCode` before installation. Falls back to opening the release page when running unsigned (dev builds).

### TextInjector.swift — Universal Paste
Saves current clipboard, sets transcribed text, simulates Cmd+V via `CGEvent`, then restores previous clipboard after 0.5s (checking `changeCount` to avoid clobbering user activity). Works in any app including terminals.

### BundleExtension.swift — Resource Resolution
SPM's generated `Bundle.module` looks at the `.app` root, but signed bundles need resources in `Contents/Resources/`. `Bundle.appResources` checks the correct path first, then the executable-adjacent path, falling back to `Bundle.main` for safe degradation.

## Threading Model

- **Main thread (`@MainActor`):** All UI state updates, AppState methods
- **Audio thread:** AVAudioEngine tap callback → buffer append via `bufferQueue`
- **Background:** Model downloads (URLSession), whisper inference (async/await)
- **CGEvent callback:** Hotkey detection, dispatches to main via `DispatchQueue.main.async`

## Build & Release

### Local
```bash
SIGNING_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: ..." \
NOTARIZE_PROFILE="FreeWispr-notarize" \
  ./scripts/build-and-notarize.sh <version>
```

Stages: `swift build` → assemble `.app` → codesign → notarize → staple → create DMG

### CI/CD
Push a version tag (`v*`) to trigger `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Requires these GitHub secrets:
- `CERTIFICATE_P12` — base64 .p12 signing cert
- `CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_ID`, `APPLE_TEAM_ID`, `APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`

The workflow installs the cert in a temp keychain, builds, signs, notarizes, creates DMG, and publishes a GitHub Release.

## Permissions

| Permission | Why | Triggered by |
|---|---|---|
| Accessibility | CGEvent tap for global hotkey | `AXIsProcessTrustedWithOptions` on setup |
| Microphone | Audio capture | System prompt on first `AVAudioEngine.start()` |

## Entitlements
- `com.apple.security.cs.allow-unsigned-executable-memory` — JIT for whisper.cpp
- `com.apple.security.device.audio-input` — microphone access

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| Menu bar app (`LSUIElement`) | Always available, no dock clutter |
| Push-to-talk | Precise control, low latency, familiar UX |
| Clipboard + Cmd+V | Universal — works in every app including terminals |
| Fresh engine per recording | Avoids stale device formats after Teams or USB/dock route changes |
| Engine start/stop per recording | Mic indicator only shows while dictating |
| Greedy + single segment | Fastest inference for short dictation clips |
| Core ML encoder | Apple Neural Engine acceleration on Apple Silicon |
| 30s inference timeout | Prevent hung whisper.cpp from blocking the app |
| 5s LLM correction timeout | Correction is nice-to-have; raw transcription is the core value |
| Download before unload | Failed model downloads keep previous model functional |
| GGML magic byte validation | Detect corrupt downloads before loading into whisper.cpp |
| Peak normalization to 0.7 | Consistent amplitude for quiet recordings improves transcription |
